# Ubuntu Packer Template
If you want to create an Ubuntu image template and other repos are not willing to help you, well, this repo is the one.
I tried every repo out there but all of them were confusing and some of them were out of date and didn't work.
Here, you can create an Ubuntu 22.04 image template, and install necessary stuff on it with the help of Ansible.
